    "In this unit, we are going to  learn a new data structure with richer features compared to lists. The problem with lists, while flexible enough to store different data types in one variable, is that it does not provide us a way to \"label\" that information with meta data. For example in a list `['Andy', 28, 980.15]`, we would like to be able to associate with the value `Andy` a label or key `'name'` so that we don't have to keep on recalling that a staff's name is located in the first position of the list.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we will cover the `for` and `if else` construct. \n",
    "Technically speaking, armed with the basic tools that we have learnt from the previous unit, we *could* go about writing code and basic scripts. But with these keywords, what can achieved is rather limited. Worse, the process of writing code will be tedious and unenlightening. From a scientific and analytic point of view, writing code is not only an ends to obtaining the results we want, but a way for us to structure our thinking and come to an understanding of the problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives for this unit\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use the `dict` data structure and related methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To apply boolen conditionals to control `if`, `if else` and `if elif` statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use the `for` loop to iterate through repetitive calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "# The dictionary\n",
    "____\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists - while easy to create- have the weakness that one cannot easily retrieve data that has been already stored in it. Since the primary means of retrieving information in a list is via indexing and slicing, you need to know the exact integer positions of each data stored in the list. This can (and will often) lead to human errors in programming. Furthermore, an integer based recall is unenlightening. Other people who reads your code will find it difficult to understand what is being written. \n",
    "\n",
    "To remedy this, Python has built into its base package a data structure called **dictionaries**. A dictionary is simply a key-value pairing like so $$(key_1, value_1), (key_2, value_2)\\ldots, (key_n, value_n)$$ where $key_i$ are usually (but not always) strings and $value_i$ any Python object (`int`, `str`, `list` and even other `dict`!) \n",
    "\n",
    "If `my_dictionary` is a dictionary. Then calling `my_dictionary[key_1]` will return you the value associated with `key_1` in `my_dictionary`, say `value_1`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries are created using curly braces `{ }`. Inside the curly braces, we simply list down all the key-value pairs using the `:` operator. Different pairs are seperated by a `,`. "
