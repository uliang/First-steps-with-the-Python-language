    "# Python functions \n",
    "________\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, a portion of code is reused over and over again in the entire script. To prevent repetitive coding, we are able to define our own custom defined functions using the `def` keyword. When invoked, functions will instruct the computer to perform a set list of instructions, possibly returning an output at the end. Functions can also be pre-defined and saved in another file (with extension `.py`) so that it can be used for another project. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will have encountered many pre-defined functions in Python up to now. Functions like `print`, `len`, etc... But there are many other pre-built functions in Python which are extremely useful and makes code more transparent and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also encounter what is known as anonymous functions which are defined using the `lambda` keyword. These are short functions and can only be defined in one line of code. While technically `def` does what `lambda` does, nevertheless `lambda` allows for less pendantic and more natural style of coding. You will encounter anonymous functions alot when working with `pandas` especially when cleaning up data frames. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we introduce what is perhaps one of the more important concepts in Python programming: List comprehensions. These are syntatical shortcuts for the `for` loop which translate not only to better code style, but faster scripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this unit are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use the `def` keyword to defined functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Recall the terms  arguments, keyword arguments, the signature of a function. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use `lambda` to define anonymous functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To use build in  functions: `zip` and `enumerate`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. To learn how to refactor `for` loops into list comprehension statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's build our own functions\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions are defined using the `def` keyword. In general, the format of function definition looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "    def my_function_name(arg_1, arg_2, ..., arg_n) : \n",
    "    \n",
    "        code\n",
    "        \n",
    "        return <something, or None> \n",
    "        \n",
    "First, we tell Python that we are going to define a function by typing out `def`. Then we proceed by naming our function. The normal rules for naming variables apply to naming functions as well - one cannot start a name with a number or use special characters or use words which have been reserved for Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then after the name, we describe the *signature* of the function by writing down every argument to the function seperated by commas and enclosed in round braces `( )`. And *argument* to a function is an input to the code which will be executed when the function is *called*. It is not mandatory that a function recieve inputs. Sometimes, a function just needs to run a set of instructions, without any input. We end the `def` statement with a `:`. The newline under this marks the beginning of the function code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every line of code meant for the function *must* be indented. There are no enclosing `{ }` which marks the \"body\" of the function. In Python, the \"body\" of the function is denoted with indentation only. Thus, every line of code meant for the function must be on the same indentation level. Finally, at the end of the function we `return` an output or `None`. While this last syntax is not mandatory, it is not good practice to leave off a function definition *without* a `return` statement.  "

While I will not go through the mathematical details of RSA, I will describe an outline of the program. The script is an attempt to simulate communication between two people Alice and Bob. Bob wants to send Alice his 16 digit credit card number securely over an open channel and Alice will need to decrypt that message. The script attempts to simulate this interaction. \n",

Nobody but Alice can have knowledge of the private key as it will be used to decrypt Bob's message. But since this is a demo, we will all know this number. \n",
