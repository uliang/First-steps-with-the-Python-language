Introduction to base python and programming constructs

This the jupyter notebook for a two day course in Python for Data visualization and analysis. The material here covers basic Python programming concepts. 

In the second day, we cover the usage of `matplotlib` to create scientific 
visualisations. 

## Contents

### Unit 1.1

1. The `print` command, Hello world! and a quick walkthough Jupyter Notebooks. 
1. The basic objects of Python: `int`, `str`, `float` and `bool`. Arithmetic operations and concatenation. The `type` function. 
1. `str` objects. Accessing and manipulating strings.
1. `list` objects. Slicing and indexing lists. `pop` and `insert` methods.

### Unit 1.2


1. The `dict` data structure. Learning about `.keys` and `.items` methods. How to update dictionaries
1. The `if`, `else` and `elif` construct. Conditionals. 
1. The `for` construct. Iterating through a `list` or `string`. Using `break` to exit a loop prematurely. 


### Unit 1.3 
1. Introducing functions. The `def` keyword. Defining and calling functions. Scope and keyword arguments. 
1. Anonymous functions. The `lambda` keyword. 
1. Built in Python functions: `zip` and `enumerate`.
1. List comprehension. 

### Unit 3.1
1. Introducing basic function of the `plot` function. 
1. Using `plot` to create time series plots and scatterplots.
1. Use `matplotlib` marker codes to customize our graph. 
1. Use `color`, `label` and `alpha` keyword arguments to customize plots. 
1. Explain the basic objects of `matplotlib`, the `figure` and `axes` class 
and how to instantiate them.
